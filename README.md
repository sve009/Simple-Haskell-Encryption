# Simple-Haskell-Encryption
After learning a little bit of Haskell I decided to try and see if I could make a program to encrypt text files using a key provided by the user. 


# Disclaimer

<strong>This is a project created to help learn more about different aspects of Haskell, it is in no way meant to be a secure form of encryption.</strong>

# Usage

The only file includes is the source file, which can be compiled by ghc. 

The binary can be run with four different flags:
 
  -e: encrypts a string. Takes two arguments, the first being the string and the second being the key.
  
  -ef: ecrypts a file. Takes two arguments, the filepath and key respectively.
  
  -d: decrypts a string. Takes two arguments, the string and key respectively.
  
  -df: decrypts a file. Takes two arguments, the filepath and key.
  
  # Code
  
  If anyone wishes to look at the source code and suggest improvements or better practices it would be greatly appreciated.
  
  This project was an opportunity to learn, so any suggestions could aid that mission.
